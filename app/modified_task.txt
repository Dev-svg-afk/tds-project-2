Clean and transform the raw tabular data obtained from scraping. This involves: 1) Parsing 'Worldwide gross' values into a consistent numeric format (e.g., USD in billions or millions, ensure it's a number). 2) Extracting and converting 'Year' into an integer. 3) Converting 'Rank' and 'Peak' columns into integer types. Handle any non-numeric characters, missing values, or inconsistencies to ensure data is ready for numerical analysis and filtering.
