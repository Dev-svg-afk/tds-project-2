Inlcude a dependencies script for the given code so that it can run with "uv run ..."
Format:
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#    "dependency1",
#    "dependency2",
#    "dependency3",
#    ...
# ]
# ///
Just return the modified python code, do not include comments or explanations of any sort.
Important points to take care of:
1. Only list dependencies that 'uv' requires, which means, do not include dependencies that are part of Pythonâ€™s standard library.
2. Do not change the structure of the code, just add the dependencies script at the top.
