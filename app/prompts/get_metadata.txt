The code you have been given has already been run. It has created a file.
Your task is to write a new python code to extract the metadata of that file.
Just write the python code, do not include comments or explanations of any sort.
Include any necessary libraries as uv script in the beginning of the code in the following format.
example: 
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = [
#   "dependency1",
#   "dependency1",
#   "dependency1",
# ]
# ///
Do not make up data, stick true to the data source.
In the end, the code must save the data into a file called "metadata.{relevant extention}"
