This includes: parsing numerical values from 'Worldwide gross' (e.g., removing '$' and converting to numbers, handling 'million' or 'billion' suffixes), converting 'Year' to integers, and ensuring 'Rank' and 'Peak' are treated as numerical values. Handle any missing or inconsistent data appropriately. The output should be a structured dataset (e.g., a pandas DataFrame) with appropriate data types for 'Worldwide gross', 'Year', 'Rank', and 'Peak'.",
