You are given a task and a file structure. 
An LLM is going to operate on the task.
Modify the task so that the LLM follows the file structure.
Important points to emphasize to the llm:
- The LLM should use the structure of the file only as reference, not as the actual content of the file.
- The LLM should read the file safely first, and only then perform operations on it's content.
Do not include any additional information or comments, just the modified task.
