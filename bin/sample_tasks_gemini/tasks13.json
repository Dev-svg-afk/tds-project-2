This includes parsing numerical values (e.g., 'Worldwide gross', 'Rank', 'Peak') into appropriate numeric types (e.g., float or int), extracting and converting release years from film titles or dedicated columns to integers, and handling any missing or inconsistent data. The output should be a structured dataset (e.g., a pandas DataFrame) with appropriate data types for 'Worldwide gross', 'Release Year', 'Rank', and 'Peak' (which refers to Peak position). Ensure columns are named consistently for easy access.",
